Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Marina. I`m a C++ developer.

ðŸŒ± I just finished the course of Yandex Practicum "C++ developer".

Iâ€™m gonna to look for interesting work in high-tech industries. For example, in team of self-driving cars (it`s my dream).

âš¡ About me:

I like programming. I like math, logic tasks. I know algorithms and data structures, OOP, multithreading, heredity and polymorphism.

I choose the C++ language because of its complexity and almost limitless possibilities of application.

Before C++, I learned the C language myself. I started studying C++ from S. Lippman`s book, then I came to the Yandex Practicum course.

I like to read, especially autobiographies.
